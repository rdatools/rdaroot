# Root Maps

These root maps were copied from the alecramsay/baseline repository on 03/11/24 and renamed.

The file names are of the form {xx}20{abbr}_root_map.csv, 
where {xx} is the two-character state code and 
{abbr} is the capitalized first letter of the type of plan--Congress, Upper state house, or Lower state house.
